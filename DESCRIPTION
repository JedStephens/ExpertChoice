Description: An R package to support the design of discrete choice and conjoint analysis especially on expert surveys. (i.e. designs without blocking). Designs can be formed on the basis of orthogonal arrays or search methods for optimal designs (Federov). Various methods for converting the design into a discrete choice experiment. Many efficiency measures!
