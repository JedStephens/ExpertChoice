#' Fractional Factorial Design Efficiency
#'
#' @param formula A specification, in formula form, of the desired effects sought to be estimated.
#' @param searched_fractional_factorial a fractional factorial generated as the result of a `search_design`.

#' @return a list with the following objects:
#' 1. X - This is the formula expanded version of the fractional factorial which was passed to the function.
#' 2. information_mat - This is the information matrix described by the associated note. Note: it is rounded to three decimal places to ease reading.
#' 3. inv_information_mat - This is the inverse of the information matrix. Note: it is rounded to three decimal places to ease reading.
#' 4. lamda_mat - This is the diagonal elements of the Lamda Matrix described by Kuhfeld (pg. 62). The elements are the eigen values of the inv_information_mat.
#' 5. inv_diag - This is the diagonal elements of the inv_information_mat. (May be of use to some researchers...)
#' 6. GWLP - This is the generalised world lengths for the searched design. (Note: this would not change depending on what is in the formula expansion.)
#' 7. A_eff - This is the A-efficiency of the design given the particular formula expansion.
#' 8. D_eff - This is the D-efficiency of the design given the particular formula expansion.
