\title{Full Factorial Design}
\usage{
full_factorial(attributes_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{attributes_list}{A named list: giving the variable name and the levels as characters. The levels should start from the base of either "0" or "1" and go up in integer values.}
}
\value{
a `data.frame` with the full factorial design and factors coded using standardised orthogonal contrast coding.
}
\description{
Generates the full factorial design with all the factors coded using standardised orthogonal contrast coding.
}
\examples{
# See step 1 of the Practical Introduction to ExpertChoice vignette.
attrshort  = list(condition = c("0", "1", "2"),
technical =c("0", "1", "2"),
provenance = c("0", "1"))
full_factorial(attrshort)
