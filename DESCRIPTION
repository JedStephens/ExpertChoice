Description: An R package to support designing efficient Discrete Choice Experiments. Experimental designs can be formed on the basis of orthogonal arrays or search methods for optimal designs (Federov or MIP programs). Various methods for converting these experimental designs into a discrete choice experiment. Many efficiency measures!
